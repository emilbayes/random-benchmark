Random Benchmark
================

This is not a random benchmark! ... or is it?
The suite was developed to track the performance progress of `xorshift`, which
[@AndreasMadsen](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen) and I co-developed during a
Node.js hackathon in Copenhagen.

Suite
-----

The benchmark includes the following npm packages:

* `Math.random()`
* [`mersenne`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mersenne)
* [`mt19937`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mt19937) *(Native)*
* [`uupaa.random.js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/uupaa.random.js)
* [`xorshift`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/xorshift)

**Methodology**: To keep comparisons consistent, all packages are benchmarked on
their ability to generate doubles in the range [0, 1). If this is not provided
with the package, normalisation is done in the appropiate wrapper.

Each package is sampled 100 times, by running 1e6 iterations and then normalising
the mean and standard deviation with the number of iterations, to get a measure
for the performance of a single operation, even though this may be misleading
because all the operations of a single package are batched.

Installation
------------

```bash
npm install random-benchmark
```

Usage
-----

```bash
random-benchmark
```

Development
-----------

The benchmark is strongly inspired by
[htmlparser-benchmark](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/htmlparser-benchmark)
and [levinstein-benchmark](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/levenshtein-benchmark).
It is composed of four layers:

* `index.js` is the general CLI interface. The available wrappers are loaded here
  and spawned as workers.
* `worker.js` is responsible for taking a given wrapper and turning it into a benchmark
  as well as monitoring progress.
* `benchmark.js` is the abstract "class", where the nitty-gritty details of running
  each wrapper is implemented, as well as calculating statistics using
  [`summary`](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/summary).
* `wrapper/*.js` is a file for each benchmark to run in the suite. A wrapper follows
  the signature `fn(iterations, callback)`, where `callback` is a standard Node.js
  style callback. `iterations` is how many times the operation should be repeated
  for the current sample. `Benchmark` will repeat this several times to calculate
  a sample mean.
